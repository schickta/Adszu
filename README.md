The New World Order of Shopping

With the advent of ecommerce technologies and smartphones equipped with cameras, GPS and
Internet connectivity, the act of “shopping” as we once knew it has changed dramatically.
Now “shopping commandos” rappel in to their favorite retailer. Using their smartphone,
they scan the manufacturer code of a TV or home appliance, compare prices and specs
online, and then purchase at the store. Or, if the discounts are worthwhile, they head
back to their “home base” to purchase online.
Rather than browsing, perhaps to pick up a few items that catch their eye, these shopping
commandos make surgical strikes; visiting a retailer to buy that one targeted item. They
quickly make their purchase, and then disappear as stealthily as they arrived.
